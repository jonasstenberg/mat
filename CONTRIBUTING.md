# Contributing to Mat

I appreciate any kind of contributions (except recipes, those I won't to add myself) ❤️

# Code / Development

All code is Javascript with a touch of Typescript magic.

## Forking

I recommend you fork the repository to push changes to your personal fork. When you want to share what you have done, open a pull request from your user-owned fork.

## Setup Development Environment

### Website

1. Install dependencies
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Run the server and the client
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

That's it!
